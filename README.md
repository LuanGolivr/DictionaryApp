# DictionaryApp
A dictionary app.
# WHAT IS IT , HOW IS IT WORKS AND WHY AM I BUILDING ?

#1 - WHAT ?
Basically this app is a desktop application where you are able to create multiple disctionaries to every single languague you're currently learning and add new words in those disctionaries , let's say your native languague is Portuguese(in my case) and you're learning German , we know that every single language tend to have many different words and to become fluent in a certain language you must have a huge vocabulary or at least a reasonable one.

#2 - HOW ?
So , instead you create a Excel Sheet to add every single word you've learnt or write down the word in a notebok or something like that. You can use this desktop app, as I said you can create an dictionary for the german language and inside of this dictionary keep adding words and its translation to you native language, you also are able to add a description about that word and futhermore you can add an example(sentence) using that word.

#3 - WHY ?
I'm still working on this app but the main reason for why I'm building this is like , I'm learning English and one of my weakness when it comes English is the vocabulary , sometimes I feel that I have a poor vocabulary or at least a not huge one , so I started to write down a huge amont of words that I've been learnig but it comes that the Excel sheets started to become so big , like , with huge tables and etc etc etc
So I decided to build this one.

#I'M STILL WORKING ON IT !!!! ONCE I HAVE FINISHED I WILL POST MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE APP HERE IN THIS "READ ME".
